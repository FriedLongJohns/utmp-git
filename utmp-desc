echo -e "		Utmp stands for Ultra Chad Music Player, and it tries it's best to be that."
echo -e "		Utmp only can do a couple things, but as being completely written in a language meant for little-to-no complexity, it's fairly decent."
echo -e "		It essentially has the same functionality as a Discord music bot, save for the fact it runs on your computer and (typically) permanently stores it's files."

echo -e "			play : play videos from library using their indexes"
echo -e "				key 0 would play the first song in library"
echo -e "				key 0,4,2 would play the first, fifth, and then third song in library"
echo -e "				key all would play every single song in the library, in a random order"
echo -e "			expo : put all (applicable) songs in a big command you can send to a friend, which if they run, lets them download all of the same songs"

echo -e "		<key> : what this needs to be changes based on <mode>"
echo -e "			<mode> is list : <key> can be nothing, but if something it will be used as a search keyword, only returning results with that text"
echo -e "			<mode> is find : <key> can be anything (but not nothing), and make sure you put quotes around the text if it has spaces"
echo -e "			<mode> is down : <key> should be a url"
echo -e "			<mode> is play : <key> should be a bunch of numbers seperated by commas, denoting media indexes"

echo -e ""
echo -e "		-t : Play video, and then prompt for deletion"
echo -e "				 Recommended to use -t when using 'find' mode as Youtube may not always return what you wanted"
