yt-dlp and ffmpeg-based terminal music player/downloader

Hello yes it is me a real person.
I made a thing.
I stole yt-dlp and made a music player, because running yt-dlp and ffmpeg every time you want to listen to a song is not fun.
There's no ads since you're literally stealing the video file.
And since we download in .m4a (audio) instead of .mp4, you download videos very quickly.
